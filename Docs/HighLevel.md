Accountability Coach App: Requirements and High-Level Design
1. Project Overview
The Accountability Coach App is a web-based chat application designed to assist users in maintaining focus, managing tasks, and tracking productivity. The application leverages OpenAI's large language model (LLM) to act as an interactive accountability coach, checking in periodically, offering motivational feedback, troubleshooting distractions, and analyzing productivity trends. Key features include task management, mood tracking, focus streak monitoring, and conversation log analysis.
2. Requirements
2.1 Functional Requirements

Accountability Coaching

The app initiates a conversation by asking, "What are you working on right now?" to establish the user's current task.
The app checks in every 30 minutes to inquire about progress and reinforce focus.
If the user reports being distracted, the app engages in a troubleshooting dialogue to identify the cause (e.g., external interruptions, lack of motivation) and suggests strategies (e.g., Pomodoro technique, breaking tasks into smaller steps).
The app provides motivational feedback, such as "You're on a 3-task streak!" to encourage sustained focus.


To-Do List Management

Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete via chat commands (e.g., "Add task: Finish report by 5 PM").
The app displays the current to-do list on demand (e.g., "Show my tasks").
Tasks include attributes: title, description, due date (optional), and status (pending/completed).
The app reminds users of upcoming or overdue tasks during check-ins.


Mood Tracking

The app prompts users to report their mood (e.g., "How are you feeling right now? Scale of 1-10 or describe briefly") during check-ins or on command.
Mood data is stored with timestamps and associated tasks (if applicable).
Users can view a mood history summary (e.g., "Show my mood trends this week").


Focus Streaks

The app tracks consecutive task completions or focused work sessions (e.g., completing a task or working for 30 minutes without reporting distraction).
Streaks are displayed as motivational messages (e.g., "You're on a 3-task streak! Keep it up!").
Streaks reset if the user reports distraction or fails to respond to a check-in.


Conversation Logs and Distraction Analysis

All user interactions (chat messages, task updates, mood reports) are logged with timestamps.
The app analyzes logs to identify distraction patterns (e.g., frequent distractions during specific tasks or times of day).
Users can request a distraction trend report (e.g., "Show my distraction trends this week").
Logs are stored securely and accessible only to the user.


User Interface

A chat-based interface for interacting with the LLM coach.
A sidebar or panel to display the to-do list, current streak, and recent mood entries.
Buttons or commands to trigger specific actions (e.g., "Show tasks," "Log mood," "Analyze distractions").



2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

Performance

The app responds to user inputs within 2 seconds (assuming OpenAI API inference time is optimized).
Check-in reminders are triggered reliably every 30 minutes (Â±10 seconds).


Scalability

The system supports multiple concurrent users, with each user's data isolated.
The backend handles at least 1,000 active users without performance degradation.


Reliability

The app maintains 99.9% uptime, excluding scheduled maintenance.
Data (tasks, mood logs, conversation logs) is persisted reliably with no data loss.


Security

User data (tasks, moods, logs) is encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256, TLS 1.3).
Authentication is required to access the app (e.g., email/password or OAuth).
Conversation logs are private and accessible only to the authenticated user.


Usability

The interface is intuitive, with a clean design optimized for productivity (minimal distractions, clear fonts, high contrast).
The app is accessible on desktop and mobile browsers (responsive design).
Chat commands are simple and forgiving (e.g., natural language parsing for task creation).


Compatibility

The app runs on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with no additional plugins required.
The backend supports integration with OpenAI's API for LLM functionality.


Data Retention

Conversation logs, tasks, and mood data are retained for at least 6 months, with user-controlled deletion options.
Distraction trend reports cover data from the past 30 days by default.



2.3 Constraints

The app relies on OpenAI's API for chat functionality, which may introduce latency or rate limits.
No local file I/O is used in the frontend to ensure browser compatibility.
The app assumes users have a stable internet connection for real-time check-ins and data syncing.

3. High-Level Design
3.1 System Architecture
The app follows a client-server architecture with a Python FastAPI backend and a MongoDB database for persistent storage. The LLM is integrated via OpenAI's API.
Components:

Backend (Server)

Technology: Python FastAPI for RESTful API and WebSocket support.
Responsibilities:
Handle user authentication (JWT-based or OAuth).
Process chat inputs and forward them to OpenAI's API.
Parse LLM responses to extract commands (e.g., add task, log mood).
Manage task and mood data (CRUD operations).
Schedule 30-minute check-in reminders using a task scheduler (e.g., APScheduler).
Analyze conversation logs for distraction trends using basic NLP (e.g., keyword detection for "distracted," "off-task").
Serve distraction trend reports based on log analysis.

Libraries:
FastAPI for API and WebSocket endpoints.
PyMongo for MongoDB integration.
APScheduler for scheduling check-ins.
openai Python client for LLM integration.
python-jose and passlib for JWT authentication.




LLM Integration

API: OpenAI's API (e.g., gpt-4 or gpt-3.5-turbo for chat completions).
Prompt Engineering:
Initial prompt: "You are an accountability coach focused on helping users maintain productivity and focus. Ask what they're working on, check in every 30 minutes, troubleshoot distractions, and provide motivational feedback like focus streaks."
Task commands: Parse inputs like "Add task: Write essay" into structured data using regex or simple NLP.
Distraction troubleshooting: If user says "I'm distracted," respond with questions like "What's pulling your focus? Is it external or internal?" and suggest strategies.
Configuration: Use OpenAI's ChatCompletion endpoint with temperature ~0.7 for balanced creativity and consistency.


Error Handling: Fallback responses if OpenAI API is unavailable (e.g., "Let's try that again. What's your current task?"). Implement retry logic with exponential backoff.


Database

Technology: MongoDB for flexible schema (tasks, moods, logs).
Schema:
Users: { user_id, email, password_hash, created_at }
Tasks: { user_id, task_id, title, description, due_date, status, created_at, completed_at }
Moods: { user_id, mood_id, score (1-10), description, task_id (optional), timestamp }
Logs: { user_id, log_id, message, is_user (boolean), timestamp }


Indexes: user_id for fast retrieval, timestamp for time-based queries.


External Services

LLM API: OpenAI's API for chat and command parsing.
Authentication Provider: Optional OAuth (e.g., Google, GitHub) for user login.
Task Scheduler: APScheduler for scheduling 30-minute check-ins.



Data Flow:

User authentication is handled by the FastAPI backend.
The backend processes chat inputs via REST API (/chat).
The backend forwards inputs to OpenAI's API, processes responses, and updates the MongoDB database (tasks, moods, logs).
The backend sends check-in reminders every 30 minutes via WebSocket.
Distraction analysis runs periodically on the backend, querying logs and generating reports.

Chat Area: Displays conversation history and input box for user messages.
Responsive Design: Collapses sidebar into a hamburger menu on mobile.

3.3 Key Interactions

Initial Check-In:

Coach: "What are you working on right now?"
User: "Writing an essay."
Backend: Creates a task (if parsed as a task) and logs the interaction.


30-Minute Check-In:

Coach: "How's the essay going? Still focused?"
User: "Got distracted by my phone."
Coach: "Let's troubleshoot. Is the phone a big pull? Try setting it to Do Not Disturb for 25 minutes."
Backend: Logs distraction, updates streak, suggests strategy.


Task Management:

User: "Add task: Finish report by 5 PM."
Coach: "Task added: Finish report by 5 PM. Want to break it into smaller steps?"
Backend: Stores task in database, logs interaction.


Mood Tracking:

Coach: "How's your mood right now? Scale of 1-10 or describe it."
User: "Feeling 6/10, a bit overwhelmed."
Backend: Stores mood entry, associates with current task (if any).


Distraction Analysis:

User: "Show my distraction trends."
Coach: "This week, you were distracted 5 times, mostly between 2-4 PM. Phone notifications were mentioned 3 times. Try silencing notifications during that window."
Backend: Queries logs, counts distraction keywords, generates report.



3.4 Security Considerations

Authentication: JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS, managed via FastAPI's python-jose.
Data Encryption: MongoDB encryption at rest, TLS for API/WebSocket traffic.
Input Sanitization: Use FastAPI's dependency injection to sanitize chat inputs and task descriptions.
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on FastAPI endpoints and OpenAI API calls to avoid abuse.

3.5 Scalability Considerations

Horizontal Scaling: Deploy multiple FastAPI instances with Uvicorn/Gunicorn behind a load balancer.
Database Sharding: Shard MongoDB by user_id for large user bases.
Caching: Use Redis to cache recent tasks and mood entries for faster updates.
LLM Optimization: Cache common OpenAI API responses (e.g., motivational phrases) to reduce API calls and costs.

3.6 Future Enhancements

Custom Check-In Intervals: Allow users to set check-in frequency (e.g., 15 or 60 minutes).

Gamification System:
Points System:
- Earn points for actions (e.g., +1 for adding tasks, +5 for completing tasks)
- Task-type multipliers (1x for daily tasks, 2x for weekly tasks, 3x for long-term goals)
- Level progression every 100 points with visual progress bar

Achievement System:
- Milestone badges (e.g., "Task Master" for 100 tasks, "Focus Hero" for 7-day streak)
- Category-specific badges for different life aspects (shopping, health, finance)
- Visual badge showcase in user profile

Streak Mechanics:
- Daily streaks for consistent app usage
- Focus streaks for consecutive focused work sessions
- Streak maintenance reminders and celebrations

Optional Social Features:
- Anonymous leaderboards for points and streaks
- Privacy-focused rankings (e.g., "User123")
- Opt-in participation for competitive users

Rewards:
- Virtual rewards (custom themes, avatars, LLM coach tones)
- Optional real-world incentives for major milestones
- Unlockable features based on level progression

Calendar Integration: Sync tasks with Google Calendar or similar.

Advanced Analytics: Use ML to predict distraction triggers based on mood and task patterns.

4. Implementation Notes

Backend: FastAPI routes for /tasks, /moods, /logs, and /trends. WebSocket endpoint for check-in notifications. Use APScheduler for check-in scheduling.
LLM Integration: Use OpenAI's Python client (openai) with structured prompts to ensure consistent command parsing.
Database: MongoDB with TTL indexes for logs older than 6 months.
Deployment: Host on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Vercel) with auto-scaling enabled for FastAPI.

5. Risks and Mitigation

Risk: OpenAI API latency or downtime.
Mitigation: Implement fallback responses and retry logic with exponential backoff using tenacity.


Risk: Inaccurate command parsing (e.g., misinterpreting "Add task").
Mitigation: Use regex and basic NLP (e.g., spacy) to validate commands, with user confirmation for ambiguous inputs.


Risk: Overwhelming users with frequent check-ins.
Mitigation: Allow users to pause or adjust check-in frequency via API settings.


Risk: Data privacy concerns.
Mitigation: Transparent data retention policy, user-controlled deletion, and GDPR compliance.
