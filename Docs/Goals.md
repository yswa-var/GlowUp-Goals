### Step 1: Define the MVP
- **Objective**: Build a simple, functional app to validate the core concept.
- **Features**:
  - User login/registration.
  - Basic chat with an AI coach (powered by a language model).
  - Task creation and completion.
  - Periodic check-in reminders.
- **Dopamine Trigger**: Seeing the AI respond in the chat and completing your first task will spark excitement and a sense of achievement.

### Step 2: Set Up Development Environment
- **Tasks**:
  - Install Python and set up FastAPI for the backend.
  - Create a React frontend with Tailwind CSS for styling.
  - Connect to MongoDB Atlas for data storage.
- **Dopamine Trigger**: Running the app locally and seeing the skeleton come to life will feel like a big win.

---

### Step 3: Implement Authentication
- **Tasks**:
  - Build backend endpoints for user signup/login using JWT.
  - Create React pages for login and registration.

---

### Step 5: Task Management
- **Tasks**:
  - Create backend endpoints for adding, viewing, and completing tasks.
  - Build a task list and input form in React.
  - Enable task extraction from chat (e.g., "Add task: Write code" → creates a task).
- **Dopamine Trigger**: Adding a task and marking it complete will feel productive and rewarding.

---

### Step 6: Implement Check-Ins
- **Tasks**:
  - Use a scheduler (e.g., APScheduler) to send check-in prompts every 30 minutes.

---

### Step 8: Focus Streaks
- **Tasks**:
  - Track consecutive focused check-ins as a streak.
  - Show the streak count in the UI.
  - Reset streaks if focus is broken.
- **Dopamine Trigger**: Watching your streak grow will be motivating; even breaking it might spur you to try harder.

---

### Step 9: Distraction Analysis
- **Tasks**:
  - Analyze chat logs for distraction keywords (e.g., "scrolling," "tired").
  - Generate basic trend reports (e.g., "You're distracted 20% of the time").
  - Display trends on request.
- **Dopamine Trigger**: Gaining insights into your habits will feel like a step toward self-mastery.

---

### Step 10: Gamification Elements
- **Tasks**:
  - Award points for completing tasks, responding to check-ins, etc.

  - Track progress with milestones linked to tasks.
- **Dopamine Trigger**: Seeing progress on a big goal will provide a deep sense of purpose.

---

### Step 12: Security Implementation
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement data encryption (AES-256) for sensitive data
  - Set up secure API key management with environment variables
  - Add GDPR compliance features (data export, deletion)
  - Implement rate limiting and security headers
  - Add JWT token refresh mechanism
- **Dopamine Trigger**: Seeing the security audit pass with flying colors will give you a rush of accomplishment!

### Step 13: Performance Optimization
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement Redis caching for frequent queries
  - Add database indexing for faster searches
  - Optimize API response times (target: <200ms)
  - Set up load testing with 1000 concurrent users
  - Implement lazy loading for UI components
- **Dopamine Trigger**: Watching the app respond instantly will feel like magic!

### Step 14: Monitoring and Analytics
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up structured logging with loguru
  - Implement error tracking with Sentry
  - Add performance monitoring with Prometheus
  - Create a real-time analytics dashboard
  - Set up automated alerts for critical issues
- **Dopamine Trigger**: Watching the app's health metrics in real-time will be like playing a strategy game!

### Step 15: Accessibility Enhancement
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
  - Add keyboard navigation with visual focus indicators
  - Optimize for screen readers with ARIA labels
  - Create accessibility documentation

### Tips for Staying Motivated
- **Break It Down Further**: Split each step into smaller tasks (e.g., "Set up FastAPI" → "Install FastAPI," "Write first endpoint").
- **Celebrate Wins**: After each task, pause to enjoy the progress—maybe grab a snack or play a quick game.
- **Use the App**: As you build, use it to manage this project. It'll keep you engaged and test features in real time.
- **Stay Flexible**: If a step feels too big, simplify it or skip to the next one and circle back later.

### Risk Management
- **Technical Risks**:
  - API failures: Implement fallback responses
  - Data loss: Set up automated backups
  - Performance issues: Use monitoring alerts
  - Security breaches: Regular security audits

- **User Experience Risks**:
  - Overwhelming UI: Keep it simple and clean
  - Notification fatigue: Allow user control
  - Feature overload: Gradual feature rollout
