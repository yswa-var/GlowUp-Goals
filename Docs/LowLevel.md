Low-Level Design: Accountability Coach App (User-Friendly)
This low-level design (LLD) refines the Accountability Coach App to be maximally user-friendly, emphasizing simplicity, clarity, and motivational feedback. It uses a Python FastAPI backend, MongoDB database, and OpenAI API for LLM integration. The design details where the LLM is required, where it's not, and how to scrape tasks/goals to detect diversions with warnings.
1. User-Friendly Design Principles

Simplicity: Minimal steps for actions (e.g., one-click task addition).
Clarity: Clear language and response formatting.
Minimal Distractions: Focus on essential functionality.
Motivation: Positive reinforcement (e.g., "Great job!") and gamified streaks.
Flexibility: Natural language input with forgiving parsing.

2. Backend (Python FastAPI)
2.1 Project Structure

Modular Design: Organized for maintainability and user-friendly development.
main.py: FastAPI entry point.
api/: Routes for chat, tasks, moods, logs, trends.
models/: Pydantic models for data validation.
services/: Business logic (LLM, task parsing, distraction analysis).
utils/: Helpers (auth, logging, task scraping).
config/: Environment variables (API keys, MongoDB URI).



User-Friendly Tip: Use clear module names (e.g., task_manager.py) for easy navigation by developers.Trick: Auto-generate API docs with FastAPI's Swagger UI, customized with a simple, high-contrast theme.
2.2 Authentication

Implementation: JWT-based auth with python-jose and passlib (bcrypt).
Endpoints:
POST /login: Email/password or OAuth (Google/GitHub) login with clear error messages (e.g., "Wrong password, try again").
POST /register: Simple form with minimal fields (email, password).
POST /refresh-token: Auto-refresh tokens to avoid login interruptions.


User-Friendly Features:
Single sign-on (SSO) for one-tap login.
Password reset with clear instructions.
Store JWT in HTTP-only cookies for security without user effort.



Tip: Provide clear success/error responses for authentication actions.Trick: Use a "Stay logged in" option to reduce login frequency.
LLM Usage: Not required for authentication (handled by FastAPI and OAuth).
2.3 Database Integration

Technology: MongoDB with Motor for async operations.
Schema:
Users: { _id: ObjectId, email: String, password_hash: String, created_at: Date, preferences: { check_in_interval: Integer, theme: String } }
Tasks: { _id: ObjectId, user_id: ObjectId, title: String, description: String, due_date: Date, status: String, created_at: Date, completed_at: Date }
Moods: { _id: ObjectId, user_id: ObjectId, score: Integer, description: String, task_id: ObjectId, timestamp: Date }
Logs: { _id: ObjectId, user_id: ObjectId, message: String, is_user: Boolean, timestamp: Date }

Gamification Collections:
Points: { _id: ObjectId, user_id: ObjectId, points: Integer, level: Integer, last_updated: Date }
Badges: { _id: ObjectId, name: String, description: String, criteria: String, icon_url: String }
UserBadges: { _id: ObjectId, user_id: ObjectId, badge_id: ObjectId, earned_at: Date }
Streaks: { _id: ObjectId, user_id: ObjectId, daily_streak: Integer, focus_streak: Integer, last_updated: Date }
Leaderboard: { _id: ObjectId, user_id: ObjectId, points: Integer, rank: Integer, updated_at: Date }

Indexes: user_id for fast queries, timestamp for time-based analysis, rank for leaderboard sorting.
Retention: TTL index on logs for 6-month expiry, leaderboard entries updated daily.

User-Friendly Tip: Store user preferences (e.g., check-in frequency, dark mode) in the Users collection.Trick: Use capped collections for logs to auto-limit size, reducing maintenance.
LLM Usage: Not required for database operations (handled by MongoDB).
2.4 API Endpoints

Chat: POST /chat – Send user message to OpenAI API, parse response for commands, log conversation.
Tasks: 
POST /tasks: Add task (parsed from chat or direct input).
GET /tasks: List tasks with status filters.
PUT /tasks/{task_id}: Update task (e.g., mark complete).
DELETE /tasks/{task_id}: Delete task.


Moods: 
POST /moods: Log mood (via chat or direct input).
GET /moods: Retrieve mood history.


Logs: GET /logs – Fetch conversation history (paginated).
Trends: GET /trends – Distraction trend report.
WebSocket: /ws/check-in – Real-time check-in reminders.

User-Friendly Tip: Return concise, friendly error messages (e.g., "Task not found, want to create one?").Trick: Use query parameters (e.g., /tasks?status=pending) for flexible filtering.
LLM Usage: Required for /chat to process user inputs and generate responses; not required for other endpoints (handled by FastAPI logic).
2.5 LLM Integration (OpenAI API)

Technology: OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo (or gpt-4 for better performance).
Prompt Design:
System Prompt: You are a friendly, supportive accountability coach. Use simple, encouraging language. Ask about current tasks, check in every 30 minutes, troubleshoot distractions with practical suggestions, and celebrate progress (e.g., "You're on a 3-task streak!"). Parse commands like "Add task: X" or "Log mood: Y" and respond clearly.


Context: Maintain last 5 messages for continuity (stored in-memory or Redis).
Commands: Parse with regex (e.g., r"Add task: (.+)", r"Log mood: (\d)/10(.*)").


Response Handling: 
Extract commands (e.g., task creation) and store in MongoDB.
Return conversational responses to the frontend.


Error Handling: 
Retry failed API calls with tenacity (exponential backoff, max 3 retries).
Fallback: "Oops, let's try again. What's your current task?"



User-Friendly Tip: Craft LLM responses to be short, positive, and actionable (e.g., "Got it! Task added. Keep rocking it!").Trick: Cache common responses (e.g., motivational phrases) in Redis to reduce API costs and latency.
LLM Usage: Required for chat interactions and command parsing; not required for data storage or retrieval.
2.6 Task/Goal Scraping and Diversion Detection

Scraping Logic:
Input Parsing: Use regex to extract tasks from chat inputs (e.g., r"Add task: (.+?)(?: by (\d{1,2}:\d{2} [AP]M))?" for title and optional due date).
Validation: Confirm with user if ambiguous (e.g., "Did you mean to add 'Write essay' as a task?").
Storage: Save parsed tasks to MongoDB Tasks collection.


Diversion Detection:
Current Task Tracking: Store the current task ID in a user session (Redis or MongoDB).
Comparison: When a new task is added, compare it to the current task (if any) using simple string similarity (e.g., difflib for fuzzy matching) or keyword overlap.
Warning Logic: 
If the new task differs significantly (e.g., similarity score < 0.7), trigger a warning via LLM: "Looks like you're switching to a new task. Want to finish '[Previous Task]' first?"
Store diversion events in Logs with a flag (is_diversion: Boolean).


Frontend Display: Show warnings as non-intrusive banners (e.g., "You're switching tasks. Stay focused?" with "Continue"/"Switch" buttons).


Implementation:
Backend: Add a services/task_parser.py module to handle scraping and diversion detection.
Algorithm:import difflib
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Task(BaseModel):
    title: str
    description: str | None = None

def detect_diversion(new_task: str, current_task: str | None) -> bool:
    if not current_task:
        return False
    similarity = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, new_task.lower(), current_task.lower()).ratio()
    return similarity < 0.7


Storage: Update Tasks collection with a previous_task_id field to track task history.



User-Friendly Tip: Make warnings gentle and optional (e.g., "No worries if you want to switch!") to avoid overwhelming users.Trick: Allow users to disable diversion warnings in preferences for flexibility.
LLM Usage: Required for generating warning messages and confirming ambiguous tasks; not required for scraping or similarity comparison (handled by regex and difflib).
2.7 Scheduling Check-Ins

Implementation: Use APScheduler (BackgroundScheduler) for 30-minute check-ins per user.
Logic:
Store check-in schedules in Redis (user_id:check_in_time).
Trigger WebSocket messages: "How's [task] going? Still focused?"


User-Friendly Features:
Allow users to adjust interval (15, 30, 60 minutes) via chat or settings.
Pause check-ins with a command (e.g., "Pause check-ins for 1 hour").
Gentle reminders with motivational tone (e.g., "You've got this!").



Tip: Provide a snooze button (e.g., "Remind me in 10 minutes").Trick: Store user's last interaction time to avoid check-ins during inactivity.
LLM Usage: Required for generating check-in messages; not required for scheduling (handled by APScheduler).
2.8 Distraction Analysis

Implementation:
Query Logs collection for keywords (e.g., "distracted", "off-task") using MongoDB text search.
Aggregate by time, task, and frequency.
Generate reports: "You were distracted 3 times this week, mostly in the afternoon."


User-Friendly Features:
Simplify reports with visual summaries (e.g., bar chart of distraction times).
Offer actionable tips (e.g., "Try silencing notifications from 2-4 PM").


Execution: Run as a background task with APScheduler.

Tip: Present trends in a conversational tone via LLM.Trick: Cache analysis results in Redis to avoid frequent queries.
LLM Usage: Required for generating conversational trend reports; not required for data aggregation (handled by MongoDB).
2.9 Performance Optimization

Async: Use async/await for database, API, and WebSocket operations.
Caching: Redis for tasks, moods, and cached LLM responses.
Connection Pooling: Configure Motor for MongoDB connection reuse.

Tip: Optimize regex patterns for speed using compiled regex (re.compile).Trick: Use FastAPI's BackgroundTasks for non-critical operations (e.g., log writes).
2.10 Error Handling & Logging

Exceptions: Custom FastAPI handlers for user-friendly errors (e.g., "Task not found, try adding one!").
Logging: Use loguru with structured JSON logs.
Monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana for API latency and error rates.

Tip: Show errors as dismissible alerts with retry options.Trick: Log user interactions anonymously for usage analytics without compromising privacy.
2.11 Security

Sanitization: Use pydantic for input validation, escape HTML in chat inputs.
Rate Limiting: Apply to API/WebSocket with slowapi.
Encryption: TLS for all traffic, MongoDB encryption at rest.

Tip: Provide a clear privacy policy in the UI.Trick: Use OWASP ZAP for automated security testing.
3. Frontend (React with Tailwind CSS)
3.1 Component Structure

App.js: Manages routing and global state (tasks, streak, moods).
ChatComponent: Displays chat history, input box, and LLM responses.
SidebarComponent: Shows tasks, streak counter, mood log, and trends button.
AuthComponents: Login/register forms with minimal fields.
SettingsComponent: User preferences (check-in interval, theme).

User-Friendly Tip: Use large, tappable buttons for all actions.Trick: Save UI state (e.g., open sidebar) in localStorage for persistence.
3.2 Real-Time Features

WebSocket: Custom useWebSocket hook for check-in reminders.
Updates: Use react-query for optimistic updates (tasks, moods).

Tip: Show a subtle notification dot for new check-ins.Trick: Reconnect WebSocket automatically on network issues.
LLM Usage: Not required (handled by backend API calls).
3.3 UI Design

Productivity-Focused Design:
High-contrast colors (e.g., dark text on white background).
Large, readable fonts (min 16px, sans-serif like Inter).
No animations or flashing elements.
Clear call-to-action buttons (e.g., "Add Task", "Log Mood").


Tailwind CSS: Utility-first classes for consistent styling.
Responsive: Collapsible sidebar on mobile with hamburger menu.
Mockup:----------------------------------------
| Sidebar       | Chat Area            |
|               |                      |
| Tasks:        | Coach: How's it going? |
| ✓ Task 1      | You: I'm distracted... |
| ☐ Task 2      | Coach: Let's fix that! |
|               | [Input: "Log mood: 6"] |
| Streak: 3     |                      |
| Mood: 7/10    | [Warning: New task?] |
| [Trends]      |                      |
----------------------------------------



Tip: Use color-coded task statuses (green for done, gray for pending).Trick: Add a "Focus Mode" toggle to hide sidebar and maximize chat area.
3.4 Accessibility

WCAG 2.1: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels (e.g., aria-label="Add task button").
Keyboard Navigation: Tab through all controls.
Screen Readers: Test with NVDA/VoiceOver.

Tip: Provide text alternatives for all buttons (e.g., "Mark as Done").Trick: Use focus:outline-none with Tailwind for custom focus styles.
3.5 Performance

Lazy Loading: Load Trends component only when requested.
Memoization: Use React.memo for ChatComponent, useMemo for task lists.
Bundle Size: Use CDN for React (cdn.jsdelivr.net) to reduce load time.

Tip: Preload critical components (Chat, Sidebar) for instant rendering.Trick: Use react-query to cache API responses locally.
LLM Usage: Not required (all frontend logic is UI-driven).
4. Database (MongoDB)

Schema: Same as previous LLD, with added preferences in Users and previous_task_id in Tasks for diversion tracking.
Indexes: user_id, timestamp, text index on Logs.message for keyword search.
Retention: TTL for logs, manual deletion for tasks/moods via API.

User-Friendly Tip: Provide API endpoints for data export (e.g., CSV format).
Trick: Use MongoDB aggregation pipelines for efficient trend analysis.
LLM Usage: Not required (handled by MongoDB queries).
5. LLM Integration (OpenAI API)

Where Required:
Chat Processing: Generating conversational responses, check-in prompts, and distraction troubleshooting.
Command Parsing Confirmation: Confirming ambiguous task/mood inputs (e.g., "Did you mean to add this task?").
Trend Reporting: Crafting conversational summaries of distraction trends.


Where Not Required:
Authentication, database operations, task scraping (regex/difflib), scheduling, and most API logic.


Implementation Details:
Use openai.ChatCompletion.create with gpt-3.5-turbo.
Limit max_tokens (e.g., 200) for cost efficiency.
Store context in Redis for session continuity.


Error Handling: Fallback to static messages if API fails.

User-Friendly Tip: Use emojis (e.g., 🎉 for streaks) in LLM responses for visual appeal.
